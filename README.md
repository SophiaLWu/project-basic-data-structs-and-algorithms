#Project: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

This project involves creating basic data structures and algorithms.
The two projects are:

1. **Searching Binary Trees**: Build a simple binary tree structure and methods to allow both breadth_first and depth_first searching

2. **Knightâ€™s Travails**: Build a function that shows the simplest way to get a knight from one square on a chess board to another
